    <h2>Essay</h2>
    <p> is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. 
        He is the second born, as well as youngest son and child of Bardock and Gine, the husband of Chi-Chi, and the father of Gohan and Goten. 
        Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. 
        A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. 
        Goku constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior that he can possibly be, which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.</p>
